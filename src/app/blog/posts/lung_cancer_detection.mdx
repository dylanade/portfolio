## Abstract

Lung cancer is a significant contributor to cancer-related mortality. With recent advancements in Computer Vision, Vision Transformers have gained traction and shown remarkable success in medical image analysis. This study explored the potential of Vision Transformer models, including **ViT**, **CVT**, **CCT ViT**, **Parallel ViT**, and **Efficient ViT**, compared to established **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** for lung cancer detection across imaging modalities like **CT scans** and **histopathological images**. The impact of **data availability** and various **training approaches**, such as **Supervised Learning** and **Transfer Learning**, on model performance was rigorously evaluated. Key evaluation metrics such as **accuracy**, **recall**, **precision**, **F1-score**, and **AUC-ROC** were used to assess performance, focusing on detection efficacy, data validity, and computational efficiency. Notably, the **Vision Transformer (ViT)** model achieved:

- **94% accuracy** on a **balanced dataset**
- **87% accuracy** on an **imbalanced dataset**

Furthermore, **cost-sensitive metrics**, including **cost matrices** and **weighted loss functions**, provided insights into the real-world implications of model errors, particularly where false negatives (missed cancer cases) carry critical consequences.
